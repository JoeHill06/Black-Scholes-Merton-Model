# Black-Scholes-Merton Model

The **Black-Scholes-Merton model** calculates the fair price of **European options** using the underlying assetâ€™s price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free rate, and volatility. It assumes constant volatility and no arbitrage, providing a widely used formula for pricing and hedging in financial markets.

## Brief Explanation

The **Black-Scholes model** is a mathematical formula used to calculate the **fair price of an option**.

![BlackScholesEquation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fa32f53-38d1-4532-9f6e-cf7357e071ab)

### Where:
- **St**: Current stock price.
- **K**: Strike (exercise) price.
- **N(d1), N(d2)**: Cumulative probability distributions.
- **e^(-rt)**: Discount factor (where `r` is the risk-free interest rate, and `t` is the time to expiration).

### What is an option?
An **option** is a financial contract giving the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to **buy** or **sell** an asset (like a stock) at a fixed price (strike price) before or on a specific date.

### What does the model do?

It helps answer: **How much is this option worth today?**

To do this, the model considers:
1. **Stock price**: Current value of the stock.
2. **Strike price**: Price at which the option can be exercised.
3. **Time to expiration**: Remaining time until the option expires.
4. **Risk-free interest rate**: The return from a "risk-free" investment (e.g., government bonds).
5. **Volatility**: Expected price fluctuations of the stock.

---

### Why is it useful?

Traders and investors use it to:
- Determine the **fair price** of an option.
- Assess the **risk** and **reward** of an option.
- Evaluate if an option is **overpriced** or **underpriced** in the market.

### Example Usage
Here's an example of how you can use `yfinance` to retrieve and display data:

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Initialize the Ticker object for Microsoft
ticker = yf.Ticker("MSFT")

# Get and print company info
print("Company Info:")
print(ticker.info)

# Get historical price data for the last month
print("\nHistorical Prices (1 month):")
print(ticker.history(period='1mo'))

# Get upcoming earnings calendar
print("\nEarnings Calendar:")
print(ticker.calendar)

# Get call options for the nearest expiration date
if ticker.options:
    nearest_exp = ticker.options[0]
    call_options = ticker.option_chain(nearest_exp).calls
    print("\nCall Options:")
    print(call_options)
else:
    print("\nNo options available.")
